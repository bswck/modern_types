PEP 585 + PEP 604 backports, because it started becoming annoying.

# What does it do?
Prevents type errors in evaluating PEP 585 and PEP 604 type annotations for Python 3.8 and 3.9,
which might happen in pydantic models for example.

```py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import get_type_hints

import __modern_types__

class Foo:
    a: dict[str, int]
    b: list[int]
    c: set[int]
    d: tuple[int, ...] | None
    e: frozenset[int]

print(get_type_hints(Foo))
```
gives:
```py
{
    "a": Dict[str, int],
    "b": List[int],
    "c": Set[int],
    "d": Union[Tuple[int, ...], None],
    "e": FrozenSet[int],
}
```

# How to use?
Simply import `__modern_types__` in your code, and it will override the default global namespace of `typing.get_type_hints`.

And now you can use modern types everywhere in your code and completely forget that `typing.Dict`, `typing.List`, etc. ever existed!

# Can it be used in production?
Yes, it won't break anything. The hack simply overrides the default global namespace of `typing.get_type_hints`,
but if some keys that `__modern_types__` would supply are present, they are used instead.

> [!Note]
> If you use Windows, it is highly recommended to complete the installation in the way presented below through [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).



1.  Fork the [modern_types repository](https://github.com/bswck/modern_types) on GitHub.

1.  [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).<br/>
    Poetry is an amazing tool for managing dependencies & virtual environments, building packages and publishing them.
    You might use [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx#readme) to install it globally (recommended):

    ```shell
    pipx install poetry
    ```

    <sub>If you encounter any problems, refer to [the official documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for the most up-to-date installation instructions.</sub>

    Be sure to have Python 3.8 installed‚Äîif you use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#readme), simply run:

    ```shell
    pyenv install 3.8
    ```

1.  Clone your fork locally and install dependencies.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/modern_types path/to/modern_types
    cd path/to/modern_types
    poetry env use $(cat .python-version)
    poetry install
    ```

    Next up, simply activate the virtual environment and install pre-commit hooks:

    ```shell
    poetry shell
    pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push
    ```
